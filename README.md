# Funtionality
## HTML :
In the html file, I have made the sturcture with four part.these are navbar, text area section , note-list, footer.<br> 
In navbar , there is one logo, which is notes wall logo.<br>
In text area section, there are three part. textarea, where you can make your note. second is color part , using it you can change the background color of note-box.third is add-button ,by clicking it you can add the whole note.<br>
In note-list part , how many note you will create that will be shown in the note-list.<br>
In footer section ,just mention that who have created this page.<br>

## CSS & Bootstarp:
I have used box property , flex property to create this UI.

## JAVASCRIPT:
QuerySelector(): by using it I targeted the element of HTML.<br>
adEventlistener(): by using it I performed two event here . these are Onclick, Onkeypress.<br>
onclick event is used on add_button so that user when click on add-button then note will be added in the note-list section. <br>
onkeypress event is used for enter. enter keycode is 13. I just used enter keycode as event.keycode === 13 . so that user can add note in the notelist by pressing enter on keyboard.<br>
The insertAdjacentHTML() method of the Element interface parses the specified text as HTML or XML and inserts the resulting nodes into the DOM tree at a specified position.<br>
"afterbegin"<br>
Just inside the element, before its first child.<br>
when i add note in  the note-list one will come before its child element. in this way note will be arenged.<br>
